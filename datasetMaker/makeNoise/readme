Reperetory where noisy file are created
The script makenoise.sh take file in pdbToSmallMrcBoxes and add noise into them using MMB. 
File generated are in xplor format--> the header seem to have a problem 
After this the python script todefine.py will translate them into mrc file.
    In order to ignore the header file the python script just take the data inside xplor file and recalculate the header.
    for the moment the mrc file will be add to correctedXplor

Usage:
bash noiseMaker.sh
python xplorToMrc.py dataXplor/*.mrc
