# If we leave readPreviousFrameFile 1 (the default), then the ions at stage n will have the same coordinates as last.(n-1).pdb. So let's turn off structure file reading:

readPreviousFrameFile 0

# if we do stage 1, where readPreviousFrameFile is false, then monoAtoms will be adopted with an offset.

# We don't need the time integrator at all, in this case. We can't turn it off, so just numReportingIntervals to the minimum possible value:

numReportingIntervals 1

#Seems to be required that we declare which chains will appear in output density maps:

fitToDensity A
#noise factor
densityNoiseScale x
#temperature noise
densityNoiseTemperature y
