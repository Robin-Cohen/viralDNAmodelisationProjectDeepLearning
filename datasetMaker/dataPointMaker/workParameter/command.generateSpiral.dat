# If we leave readPreviousFrameFile 1 (the default), then the ions at stage n will have the same coordinates as last.(n-1).pdb. So let's turn off structure file reading:
readPreviousFrameFile 0
# if we do stage 1, where readPreviousFrameFile is false, then monoAtoms will be adopted with an offset.
# We don't need the time integrator at all, in this case. We can't turn it off, so just numReportingIntervals to the minimum possible value:
numReportingIntervals 1
# We wil need the constant Pi, so define a user variable:
@pi 3.14159265358979
# We will create a single chain, chain ID Z:
spiralDNA chainID Z
# Spiral will be right handed:
spiralDNA spiralIsRightHanded 1
#generate center position in 20 type of position btw -20 and 20 (x,y,z)
spiralDNA center i
#generate different radius btw 25 and 50 (r)
spiralDNA radius j
# The pitch turns out to be pretty constant, across shells:--> should it be modify?
spiralDNA pitch 2.3
# And of course this is also quite constant:
spiralDNA helixAdvancePerBasePair .34
# The north and south pole regions have very poor resolution in this map, so we only trace over a relatively modest range of theta:
spiralDNA startTheta 1.00
spiralDNA endTheta 2.2
# This is a rotational offset, about the polar axis:
spiralDNA phiOffset  180*@pi/180

# We clear the frequencyPhaseAmplitudeVector, out of paranoia rather than necessity:
spiralDNA frequencyPhaseAmplitude clear

# If you want to make an atomistic (fine-grained) model, separately run MMB using this command file:
spiralDNA spiralCommandsFileName commands.spiral.dat
# This is where the fine grained structural coordinates will be written:
spiralDNA spiralPdbFileName spiral.pdb
