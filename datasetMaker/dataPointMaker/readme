This directory is to create data using MMB and making it variate in order to have multiple data point that we will add noise and variate after This

generatemulti.sh will generate 10 file with radius randomly distribute between 10 and 50 / and with xyz coordinates between -20 and 20
    Will generate temporary directory for work and will delete it after that
     Will copy content of work parameter and change with a sed command.generateSpiral.dat
    Will generate mmciff files that can be found in data/
multi.sh --> lauch x time generatemulti.sh and compile log output into out.log (bash multi.sh [number])
Log output are compiled into out.log

Usage of mmciff file because it seem too mush radius generated bug into pdb file
